Using *Bayesian Statistics* concepts I create a *Naive Bayes Classifier* Model from scratch and applying it on boston house dataset 

To predict the econimist classification of the house whether it is (Low, Medium, High, or very High)

Tools I used:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Seaborn & MatplotLib
- Sci-kit Learn
